Expressive online photo galleries are the new way of creative expression, allowing artists, brands and companies to provide authenticity and originality in the rising digital age. Our application depicts stock photography that allows:

1. Anyone to license images for creative or business purposes. 
2. Rather than hiring a professional photographer, individuals can upload, license, share, and sell their images, if needed. 
3. Each photo can be water marked to retain authenticity.
4. The water mark will be removed once the picture(s) is purchased completely.
5. Users can upload their images under various categories they deem fit.
6. The authority to take-down or modify the image lies solely with the authorized user.
